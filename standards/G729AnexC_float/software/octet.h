/* Definition for Octet Transmission mode */
/* When Annex B is used for transmission systems that operate on octet boundary, 
   an extra bit (with value zero) will be packed at the end of a SID bit stream. 
   This will change the number of bits in a SID bit stream from 15 bits to
   16 bits (i.e., 2 bytes).
