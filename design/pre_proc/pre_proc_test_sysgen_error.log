Error 0001:

Reported by:
  'pre_proc_test/Black Box'

Details:
An internal error occurred in the Xilinx Blockset Library.

Please report this error to Xilinx (http://support.xilinx.com),
in as much detail as possible. You may also find immediate help
in the Answers Database and other online resources at http://support.xilinx.com.

Since it is possible that this internal error resulted from an
unhandled usage error in your design, we advise you to carefully
check the usage of the block reporting the internal error. If
errors persist, we recommend that you restart MATLAB.
Error occurred during "Simulation Initialization".

Error 0001:

Reported by:
  'pre_proc_test/ModelSim'

Details:
ModelSim failed to establish communications with System Generator.

It is possible that ModelSim was unable to aquire a license.
Alternatively, this problem could have been caused by a long
startup time for ModelSim on your machine. System Generator waits
to hear from ModelSim for a fixed time period, but you can adjust
timeout setting.

To adjust the timeout, select the ModelSim block in your model
(left-click on the block), and then enter the following command
in the MATLAB console window:

set_param(gcb, 'startup_timeout', '120' );

The above setting will force System Generator to wait for 120
seconds before giving up on the ModelSim connection. If you
regularly run into this problem, you may wish to adjust the
default timeout on the library block. For further details, refer
to answer record 18926.
